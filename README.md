# 💲 Financial Sentiment Analysis for Market Trends

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to explore the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock market trends. We will collect real-world news headlines and historical stock price data, apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment, and analyze how sentiment correlates with price movements. Eventually, we may build predictive models and deploy them to the cloud.
